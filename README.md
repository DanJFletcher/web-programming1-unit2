CS 2205 Programming Assignment for Unit 2
===

The purpose of this assignment was simply to create 5 pages of content using a service like Wix - there was no requirement to actually write any code. So there is no way a student can use this project as a means of cheating on this assignment.

I decided to skip a lot of practices that would normally go into a real website and have forgone any tooling and set up for sake of simplicity. The goal was to record the entire process so that other students at UoPeople can see an example of what my process might look like in the real world, but by not using any tools and mimumal JS, it is also easy for absolute beginners to follow along.
